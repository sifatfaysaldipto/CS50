# Code Explanation

## Purpose
This Python script generates and prints a pyramid pattern based on the height input by the user.

## Functions

### `get_height()`
- This function prompts the user to input the height of the pyramid.
- It continuously loops until a valid height (an integer between 1 and 8) is entered.
- If the input is not a valid integer, it catches the `ValueError` and displays an error message.
- Once a valid height is entered, it returns the height.

### `print_pyramid(height)`
- This function takes the height of the pyramid as input and prints the pyramid pattern accordingly.
- It iterates over each line of the pyramid and prints spaces followed by hash symbols to create the pyramid shape.
- The number of spaces decreases with each line while the number of hash symbols increases.
- It uses the `end=""` parameter in the `print()` function to prevent printing a newline after each line.

## Code Execution
- The script first calls the `get_height()` function to obtain the height of the pyramid from the user.
- Then, it passes the obtained height as an argument to the `print_pyramid()` function, which prints the pyramid pattern based on the provided height.

## Note
- This script assumes the user will input a valid integer between 1 and 8 for the height of the pyramid.
- It utilizes a while loop to continuously prompt the user until a valid height is entered.
- The pyramid pattern is printed using nested loops to control the number of spaces and hash symbols on each line.
