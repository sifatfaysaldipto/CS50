# Code Explanation

## Purpose
This Python script generates and prints a double half-pyramid pattern based on the height input by the user.

## Program Description
- **mario.py (more)**: This program implements the functionality to print a double half-pyramid pattern.
- **USAGE**: The user can run the program by executing `python mario.py` in the terminal. It prompts the user to enter the height of the half-pyramid and then prints the pattern accordingly.

## Functions

### `draw(ctype, times)`
- This function is used to draw a character or string `ctype` a specified number of times `times`.
- It takes two parameters:
    - `ctype`: The character or string to be drawn.
    - `times`: The number of times to draw `ctype`.
- It prints `ctype` `times` times without appending a newline at the end.

### `main()`
- This is the main function of the program.
- It prompts the user to enter the height of the half-pyramid and validates the input to ensure it is between 1 and 8 (inclusive).
- Then, it determines the type of the Mario half-pyramid to draw and proceeds to draw the double half-pyramid pattern accordingly.

## Code Execution
- The script first imports the `get_int` function from the `cs50` library.
- It defines the `draw()` and `main()` functions to handle the drawing and main logic of the program respectively.
- In the `main()` function, it prompts the user for the height of the half-pyramid and validates the input.
- Then, it iterates through each row of the half-pyramid and prints the appropriate number of spaces, hashes, gaps, and right-side hashes to create the double half-pyramid pattern.
- Finally, it executes the `main()` function if the script is run as the main program.

## Note
- This script utilizes the `cs50` library to prompt the user for input.
- It implements a do-while loop using a `while True` loop construct to ensure that the user enters a valid height.
- The double half-pyramid pattern is created by printing the appropriate number of spaces, hashes, and gaps on each row using nested loops.
