# Code Explanation

## Purpose
This Python script prompts the user to enter their name and then greets them with a personalized message.

## Functionality
- Prompts the user to input their name using the `input()` function.
- Stores the inputted name in the variable `name`.
- Uses f-strings to construct a personalized greeting message containing the user's name.
- Prints the greeting message to the console.

## Code Breakdown
- `name = input("What is your name?\n")`: Prompts the user to input their name and stores it in the variable `name`.
- `print(f"hello, {name}")`: Prints a greeting message to the console using the value stored in the `name` variable.

## Note
- This script assumes the user will input their name as a string.
- It uses f-strings, available in Python 3.6 and later, for string interpolation to construct the greeting message.
