# Code Explanation

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to generate a pyramid pattern similar to the ones in the game Mario, based on user input for the height of the pyramid.

## Libraries
- `stdio.h`: This library provides input and output functions such as `printf`.
- `cs50.h`: This library is specific to the CS50 course and provides additional functions, including `get_int`, which is used to get an integer input from the user.

## Function: main()
- `int main(void)`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins. It returns an integer value.
    - `int size;`: This line declares an integer variable `size` to store the height of the pyramid entered by the user.
    - `do { size = get_int("Height: "); } while (size <= 0 || size >= 9);`: This do-while loop prompts the user to enter the height of the pyramid and continues to do so until the entered size is between 1 and 8.
    - `for (int i = 1; i <= size; i++) { }`: This for loop iterates from 1 to the value of `size` (inclusive), representing each row of the pyramid.
        - `for (int k = size - 1; k >= i; k--) { printf(" "); }`: This inner for loop prints spaces before the blocks on each line, ensuring proper alignment of the pyramid.
        - `for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) { printf("#"); }`: This inner for loop prints the blocks of the pyramid for each line, increasing the number of blocks in each subsequent line.
        - `printf("\n");`: This line moves to the next line after printing the blocks for the current line, ensuring each row of the pyramid is printed on a new line.

## Function: None
- This code does not contain any additional functions apart from `main()`.

## Note
- This code assumes that the CS50 library is properly installed and configured in the environment.
- It expects the user to input an integer value representing the height of the pyramid.
