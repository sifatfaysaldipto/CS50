# Code Explanation

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to validate a credit card number using Luhn's Algorithm and determine its type (Visa, MasterCard, Amex), if valid.

## Libraries
- `stdio.h`: This library provides input and output functions such as `printf`.
- `math.h`: This library provides mathematical functions, although it's not used directly in this code.
- `cs50.h`: This library is specific to the CS50 course and provides additional functions, including `get_long_long`, which is used to get a long long integer input from the user.

## Function: main()
- `int main(void)`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins. It returns an integer value.
    - `printf("credit: ");`: This line prompts the user to enter a credit card number.
    - `long long cc = get_long_long();`: This line reads the input credit card number from the user as a long long integer.
    - `long long digits = cc;`: This line initializes a variable `digits` with the value of `cc` to count the number of digits in the credit card number.
    - `int f_sum = 0;`: This line initializes a variable `f_sum` to store the sum of digits in even positions after processing according to Luhn's Algorithm.
    - `int the_result = 0;`: This line initializes a variable `the_result` to store the sum of digits in odd positions.
    - `int count = 0;`: This line initializes a variable `count` to count the total number of digits in the credit card number.
    - `int multi;`: This line declares a variable `multi` to store the result of doubling digits in even positions.
    - `int array[2];`: This line declares an array `array` to store the individual digits of a number when it's greater than 9.
    - `if (cc < 0) { printf("Enter Valid credit card number"); }`: This conditional statement checks if the credit card number is negative. If true, it prints a message indicating that the input is not valid.
    - Else:
        - It proceeds to validate the credit card number using Luhn's Algorithm and determine its type (Visa, MasterCard, Amex) if valid.

## Function: None
- This code does not contain any additional functions apart from `main()`.

## Note
- This code assumes that the CS50 library is properly installed and configured in the environment.
- It also assumes that the input for the credit card number is provided as a long long integer.
