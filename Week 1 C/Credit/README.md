# Code Explanation

## Purpose
This program verifies the validity of a credit card number using Luhn's Algorithm and identifies the card's type (Visa, MasterCard, or Amex).

## Comments
- Each line of the code is now commented to explain its purpose and functionality, enhancing code readability and understanding.
- The comments help to clarify the logic behind the credit card validation process and the implementation of Luhn's Algorithm.

## Note
- This program assumes that the CS50 library is properly installed and configured in the environment.
- It also assumes that the input credit card number is provided as a long long integer.
