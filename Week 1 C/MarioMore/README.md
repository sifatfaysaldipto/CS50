# Code Explanation

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to generate a pyramid pattern similar to the ones in the game Mario, based on user input for the height of the pyramid. The pyramid consists of blocks represented by '#' characters, with two spaces between the blocks in each row.

## Libraries
- `stdio.h`: This library provides input and output functions such as `printf`.
- `cs50.h`: This library is specific to the CS50 course and provides additional functions, including `get_int`, which is used to get an integer input from the user.

## Function: main()
- `int main(void)`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins. It returns an integer value.
    - `int height;`: This line declares an integer variable `height` to store the height of the pyramid entered by the user.
    - `do { height = get_int("Height: "); } while (height < 1 || height > 8);`: This do-while loop prompts the user to enter the height of the pyramid and continues to do so until the entered height is between 1 and 8.
    - `for (int line = 0; line < height; line++) { }`: This for loop iterates over each line of the pyramid, from the first line to the last.
        - `for (int space = height - 1; space > line; space--) { printf(" "); }`: This inner for loop prints spaces before the blocks on each line, ensuring proper alignment of the pyramid.
        - `for (int left_blocks = 0; left_blocks <= line; left_blocks++) { printf("#"); }`: This inner for loop prints the left blocks of the pyramid for each line, increasing the number of blocks in each subsequent line.
        - `printf("  ");`: This line prints two spaces between the left and right blocks of the pyramid.
        - `for (int right_blocks = 0; right_blocks <= line; right_blocks++) { printf("#"); }`: This inner for loop prints the right blocks of the pyramid for each line, increasing the number of blocks in each subsequent line.
        - `printf("\n");`: This line moves to the next line after printing the blocks for the current line, ensuring each row of the pyramid is printed on a new line.

## Function: None
- This code does not contain any additional functions apart from `main()`.

## Note
- This code assumes that the CS50 library is properly installed and configured in the environment.
- It expects the user to input an integer value representing the height of the pyramid.
