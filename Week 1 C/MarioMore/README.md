# Code Explanation

## Purpose
This program generates a pyramid of blocks based on the user-input height, where each line has increasing numbers of blocks. The blocks are separated by two spaces in the middle.

## Comments
- Each line of code is commented to explain its purpose and functionality, enhancing code readability and understanding.
- The comments help clarify the logic behind generating the pyramid structure and handling user input validation.

## Note
- This program assumes that the CS50 library is properly installed and configured in the environment.
- It also assumes that the input for the height of the pyramid is provided as an integer.
