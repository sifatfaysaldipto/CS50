# Code Explanation

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to prompt the user to input their name, then print a greeting message including the name entered.

## Libraries
- `stdio.h`: This library provides input and output functions such as `printf`.
- `cs50.h`: This library is specific to the CS50 course and provides additional functions, including `get_string`, which is used to get a string input from the user.

## Function: main()
- `int main(void)`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins. It returns an integer value.
    - `string name = get_string("What is your name: ");`: This line prompts the user to input their name using the `get_string` function from the CS50 library. The entered name is stored in the variable `name`, which is of type `string`.
    - `printf("hello, %s\n", name);`: This line prints a greeting message using `printf`. The `%s` is a format specifier for a string, and it is replaced by the value stored in the `name` variable.

## Note
- This code assumes that the CS50 library is properly installed and configured in the environment.
