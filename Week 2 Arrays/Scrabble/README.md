# Code Explanation

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to compare two words entered by players in a word game and determine the winner based on the scores calculated from the letters of the words.

## Libraries
- `ctype.h`: This library provides functions for character classification and conversion, such as `isupper` and `islower`.
- `cs50.h`: This library is specific to the CS50 course and provides additional functions, including `get_string`, which is used to get a string input from the user.
- `stdio.h`: This library provides input and output functions such as `printf`.
- `string.h`: This library provides functions for string manipulation, such as `strlen`.

## Function: main()
- `int main(void)`: This is the main function where the execution of the program begins. It returns an integer value.
    - `string word1 = get_string("Player 1: ");`: This line prompts Player 1 to enter a word using the `get_string` function. The entered word is stored in the variable `word1`, which is of type `string`.
    - `string word2 = get_string("Player 2: ");`: This line prompts Player 2 to enter a word using the `get_string` function. The entered word is stored in the variable `word2`, which is of type `string`.
    - `int score1 = compute_score(word1);`: This line calculates the score for Player 1's word using the `compute_score` function and assigns it to the variable `score1`.
    - `int score2 = compute_score(word2);`: This line calculates the score for Player 2's word using the `compute_score` function and assigns it to the variable `score2`.
    - `if (score1 > score2) { printf("Player 1 wins!\n"); }`: This conditional statement checks if the score of Player 1 is greater than the score of Player 2. If true, it prints "Player 1 wins!".
    - `else if (score1 < score2) { printf("Player 2 wins!\n"); }`: This conditional statement checks if the score of Player 2 is greater than the score of Player 1. If true, it prints "Player 2 wins!".
    - `else { printf("Tie!"); }`: This else statement is executed if both players have the same score, and it prints "Tie!".

## Function: compute_score()
- `int compute_score(string word)`: This function takes a string `word` as input and calculates its score based on the points assigned to each letter of the alphabet.
    - `int score = 0;`: This line initializes the variable `score` to 0, which will store the total score for the word.
    - `for (int i = 0, len = strlen(word); i < len; i++) { }`: This for loop iterates over each character of the word.
        - `if (isupper(word[i])) { score += POINTS[word[i] - 'A']; }`: This conditional statement checks if the character is uppercase. If true, it adds the corresponding point value to the score using the `POINTS` array.
        - `else if (islower(word[i])) { score += POINTS[word[i] - 'a']; }`: This conditional statement checks if the character is lowercase. If true, it adds the corresponding point value to the score using the `POINTS` array.
    - `return score;`: This line returns the calculated score for the word.

## Note
- This code assumes that the CS50 library is properly installed and configured in the environment.
- It also assumes that the input for the words is provided as strings.
