# Tic Tac Toe Game on Scratch

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game, created as part of my CS50 Week 0 project!

## Overview

This project is a simple yet engaging implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Scratch. It offers a fun way to challenge your friends or test your own strategic skills!

## Features

- Play against a computer AI or with a friend in 2-player mode.
- Colorful and intuitive user interface designed with Scratch's visual programming blocks.
- Enjoy smooth gameplay and interactive feedback.

## How to Play

1. Click the green flag to start the game.
2. Choose whether you want to play against the computer AI or with a friend.
3. Click on the squares to place your mark (either X or O).
4. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game!
5. If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
