# Sorting Algorithm Analysis

## Problem to Solve

Recall from lecture that we saw a few algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.

- Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct location.
- Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues until the list is sorted.
- Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the correct order.

In this problem, youâ€™ll analyze three (compiled!) sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use. In a file called `answers.txt` in a folder called `sort`, record your answers, along with an explanation for each program, by filling in the blanks marked `TODO`.
