# Code Explanation

## Libraries
- `stdio.h`: Standard Input/Output library for basic input/output operations.
- `stdint.h`: Library for integer types with specified widths.
- `stdlib.h`: Standard library in C providing functions like memory allocation, process control, and conversions.
- `cs50.h`: Header file for the CS50 library, which includes functions like `get_string()`.

## Constants
- `HEADER_SIZE`: Constant integer representing the number of bytes in a .wav header, set to 44.

## Function: main()
- `int main(int argc, char *argv[])`: The main entry point of the program. It takes command-line arguments as parameters.
    - `argc`: Number of command-line arguments.
    - `argv[]`: Array of command-line arguments.
- It checks if the number of command-line arguments is not equal to 4 and prints a usage message if the condition is true.
- Opens the input and output files specified in the command-line arguments.
- Reads the scaling factor from the command-line arguments and converts it to a floating-point number.
- Copies the header from the input .wav file to the output .wav file.
- Reads the audio samples from the input file, scales them by the factor, and writes them to the output file.
- Closes the input and output files after processing.
- Returns 0 to indicate successful execution.

## Note
- The program processes .wav files, adjusting the volume of the audio samples based on the scaling factor provided as a command-line argument.
- It handles binary files, hence the use of `"rb"` and `"wb"` for opening input and output files in binary mode.
- The audio samples are read and written as 16-bit signed integers (`int16_t`).
- It assumes that the input .wav file conforms to the standard .wav file format with a header size of 44 bytes.
