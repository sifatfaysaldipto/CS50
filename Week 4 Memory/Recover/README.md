# Code Explanation

## Purpose
This program is designed to recover JPEG images from a memory card that has been corrupted. It reads a forensic image of a memory card, iterates through each block of data, identifies the start of a JPEG file, and extracts each JPEG file by copying the relevant blocks of data.

## Functions

### `main()`
- The main function of the program.
- It checks for the correct usage of the program and opens the memory card file provided as a command-line argument.
- It reads blocks of data from the memory card and searches for the start of a new JPEG file.
- When a JPEG file is found, it creates a new output file and writes the data blocks corresponding to that JPEG file into it.
- It continues this process until the end of the memory card file is reached.
- Finally, it closes all opened files and releases memory.

## Variables and Constants
- `BLOCK_SIZE`: Constant integer representing the size of each block of data to be read from the memory card.
- `counter`: Integer variable to keep track of the number of JPEG files found on the memory card.
- `filename`: Pointer to a character array used to store the names of the output JPEG files.
- `output`: File pointer used to write data to the output JPEG files.

## Note
- This program assumes that the memory card file is provided as a command-line argument.
- It relies on the structure of JPEG files, identifying them by their file signature (first few bytes) and extracting data accordingly.
